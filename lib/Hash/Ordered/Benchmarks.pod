# PODNAME: Hash::Ordered::Benchmarks
# ABSTRACT: Ordered hash benchmarking

=head1 INTRODUCTION

The L<Hash::Ordered> internals are simple: a hash of data and an array of
ordered keys.  I thought this would perform well for common tasks and
likely outperform more complicated ordered hash implementations, so I
decided to do some benchmarking to test it.

In my review of alternatives to C<Hash::Ordered>, six seemed sufficiently
general-purpose to be worth benchmarking.  The modules tested are listed in
the benchmark output in shorthand:

=for :list
* L<Array::AsHash> — denoted C<a:ah>
* L<Array::OrdHash> — denoted C<a:oh>
* L<Data::XHash> — denoted C<d:xh>
* L<Hash::Ordered> — denoted C<h:o>
* L<Tie::Hash::Indexed> — denoted C<t:h:i>
* L<Tie::IxHash> — denoted C<t:ix>
* L<Tie::LLHash> — denoted C<t:llh>

Note that L<Tie::Hash::Indexed> is written in XS and also may require
forced installation as its tests often fail for Perl 5.18+ due to the
hash randomization change.

If there are different methods of doing something with a module, the
variations are described in each section below.

=head1 BENCHMARKS

I conducted benchmarking with the L<Benchmark> module.  The test script is
in the C<devel> directory of the distribution.  Tests were run on Perl
5.21.0 (essentially the same as 5.20.0) on a Mac Book Pro.  Each benchmark
ran for 5 CPU seconds.

Benchmarks were run at several different scales to reveal differences in
efficiency as hash size grows.  The details are described in each section
below.

A seed list of keys and values was generated from random integers
using L<Math::Random::MT::Auto>.  The same seed list was used for
all benchmarks unless otherwise noted.

I did not test advanced features of these modules, as apples-to-apples
comparison is difficult.  Still, the performance on common, simple measures
could suggest how features that combine these operations might perform.

=head2 Ordered hash creation

I tested hash creation for 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  For some modules
there were different options for creating a hash:

=for :list
* C<Array::AsHash> takes an array-reference with an option to use it directly
  or to clone it.  In one case I provided the seed list array reference
  with the clone option to true ("a:ah_cp").  In another case I created a
  new array reference from the seed list and provided it directly
  ("a:ah_rf").
* C<Tie::IxHash> can be initialized either with C<new> ("t:ix_oo") or via
  C<tie> ("t:ix_th").
* C<Data::XHash> can be created with a list ("t:xh_ls") or an array
  reference ("t:xh_rf").

As expected, when C<Array::AsHash> gets an array reference, it's very fast.
C<Tie::Hash::Indexed> does well here, also.  Of the non-XS, more hash-like
choices, C<Hash::Ordered> does well.

=head2 Getting hash elements

I tested retrieving values for 10% of the keys, randomly selected, from
hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  The hash was created beforehand so
the benchmarks reflect only element access.

Some modules had choices for how to retrieve an value, usually between a
method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference
("_rf").

Generally, method calls turned out faster than other approaches for a given
module, demonstrating the inefficiency of tied objects.

=head2 Setting hash elements

I tested changing values for 10% of the keys, randomly selected, from
hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  The hash was created beforehand so
the benchmarks reflect only element mutation.  No new keys were added.

Some modules had choices for how to modify a value, usually between a
method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference
("_rf").

Again, methods outperformed.

                a:ah 1635/s


=head2 Adding hash elements

I tested adding 10, 100 and 1000 elements to an empty hash.

Some modules had choices for how to append a value, usually between a
method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference
("_rf").

For C<Tie::LLHash>, I did not use the "lazy" option, but did the equivalent
using C<tied> and a method call:

        tied(%tllh)->last( irand(), 42 ) for 1 .. $n;

Generally, it seemed like the differences were smaller than for other
benchmarks.  Methods still outperformed.

                a:ah 1466/s


=head2 Deleting hash elements

I tested creating hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements and then deleting
10% of the keys, chosen randomly.  I would have liked to have isolated
creation from deletion, but I couldn't figure out a way to do that given
how C<Benchmark> runs the same tests over and over.

Some modules had choices for how to delete a value, usually between a
method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference
("_rf").

Interestingly, the performance of different modules changes a lot at the
three different sizes, revealing implementation differences.  (Though
recall that some of this is the creation performance difference as well as
deletion difference.)

For example, C<Tie::Hash::Indexed> XS does very well, which could be its
good creation performance, but could also be good deletion.
C<Hash::Ordered> does linear search deleting a key, which is slow at larger
sizes.  C<Tie::LLHash> really shines at larger sizes as deleting from a
linked list is faster than splicing out an element of an array.

=head2 Extracting the hash as a list

I tested getting an ordered list of pairs from hashes of 10, 100 and 1000
elements.  The hash was created beforehand so the benchmarks reflect only
conversion to a list.

Oddly, modules that usually have more than one way to do this don't for
this.  Even C<Tie::IxHash> doesn't really have an OO way to do it, so I did
it longhand:

        @list = map { $_ => $tix_oo->FETCH($_) } $tix_oo->Keys;

Because C<Array::AsHash> keeps its internal representation as an ordered
list of pairs, it outperforms the rest handily.

=head1 CONCLUSION

With the exception of hash creation and element deletion, C<Hash::Ordered>
consistently outperformed the other ordered hash implementations.  Even for
creation, it was the fastest of the pure-Perl, hash-based implementations,
often by a large margin.

However, C<Hash::Ordered> deletion gets worse as the hash size grows large.
This was an intentional trade-off, as keeping an index of keys to allow
faster deletion would slow down other operations.  I think large-scale key
deletion is probably rare in practice, but frequently using the C<push> or
C<unshift> methods on existing keys to move them to the end/start of the
list will have similar performance problems.

C<Array::AsHash>, with the opposite internal implementation compared to
C<Hash::Ordered>, performs best at creation and listing pairs, but is dead
last at element access and modification.  I believe the poor performance is
mostly due to extra indirection (e.g. an extra function call) and logic in
the element access methods.  For uses that don't require much element
access and have lots of creation/serialization, it could still be a useful
choice.

Generally, every module that depends on C<tie> for some portion of its
implementation pays a substantial performance penalty.
C<Tie::Hash::Indexed> — likely because of its XS implementation — performs
decently, but not well enough in my opinion to justify its use.

As the author of C<Hash::Ordered>, I'm clearly biased, but unless you have
very large hashes with lots of deletes, I think these benchmarks make a
very good case for it being the "go to" module for general-purpose ordered
hashes.
