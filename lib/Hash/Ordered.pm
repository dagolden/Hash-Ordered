=method new

    $oh = Hash::Ordered->new;
    $oh = Hash::Ordered->new( @pairs );

Constructs an object, with an optional list of key-value pairs.

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, @pairs ) = @_;

    return bless [ {}, [] ], $class unless @pairs;

    Carp::croak("new() requires key-value pairs") unless @pairs % 2 == 0;

    my $self = [ {@pairs}, [ map { $_ % 2 == 0 ? ( $pairs[$_] ) : () } 0 .. $#pairs ] ];

    return bless $self, $class;
}

=method clone

    $oh2 = $oh->clone;
    $oh2 = $oh->clone( @keys );

Creates a shallow copy of an ordered hash object.  If no arguments are
given, it produces an exact copy.  If a list of keys is given, the new
object includes only those keys in the given order.  Keys that aren't
in the original will have the value C<undef>.

=cut

sub clone {
    my ( $self, @keys ) = @_;
    my $clone;
    if (@keys) {
        my %subhash;
        @subhash{@keys} = @{ $self->[_DATA] }{@keys};
        $clone = [ \%subhash, \@keys ];
    }
    else {
        $clone = [ { %{ $self->[_DATA] } }, [ @{ $self->[_KEYS] } ] ];
    }
    return bless $clone, ref $self;
}

=method keys

    @keys = $oh->keys;

Returns the ordered list of keys.

=cut

sub keys {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return @{ $self->[_KEYS] };
}

=method values

    @values = $oh->values;
    @values = $oh->values( @keys );

Returns an ordered list of values.  If no arguments are given, returns
the ordered values of the entire hash.  If a list of keys is given, returns
values in order corresponding to those keys.  If a key does not exist, C<undef>
will be returned for that value.

=cut

sub values {
    my ( $self, @keys ) = @_;
    return map { $self->[_DATA]{$_} } ( @keys ? @keys : @{ $self->[_KEYS] } );
}

=method get

    $value = $oh->get("some key");

Returns the value associated with the key, or C<undef> if it does not exist in
the hash.

=cut

sub get {
    my ( $self, $key ) = @_;
    return $self->[_DATA]{$key};
}

=method set

    $oh->set("some key" => "some value");

Associates a value with a key and returns the value.  If the key does not
already exist in the hash, it will be added at the end.

=cut

sub set {
    my ( $self, $key, $value ) = @_;
    if ( !exists $self->[_DATA]{$key} ) {
        push @{ $self->[_KEYS] }, $key;
    }
    return $self->[_DATA]{$key} = $value;
}

=method exists

    if ( $oh->exists("some key") ) { ... }

Test if some key exists in the hash (without creating it).

=cut

sub exists {
    my ( $self, $key ) = @_;
    return exists $self->[_DATA]{$key};
}

=method delete

    $value = $oh->delete("some key");

Removes a key-value pair from the hash and returns the value.  This
is expensive, as the ordered list of keys has to be updated.

=cut

sub delete {
    my ( $self, $key ) = @_;
    if ( exists $self->[_DATA]{$key} ) {
        # XXX could put an index on this later if linear search is too slow
        my $r = $self->[_KEYS];
        my $i = List::Util::first { $r->[$_] eq $key } 0 .. $#$r;
        splice @$r, $i, 1;
        return delete $self->[_DATA]{$key};
    }
    return undef; ## no critic
}

=method clear

    $oh->clear;

Removes all key-value pairs from the hash.
Returns C<undef>.

=cut

sub clear {
    my $self = shift;
    %{ $self->[_DATA] } = ();
    @{ $self->[_KEYS] } = ();
    # XXX: should it return $self ?
    return undef; ## no critic
}

=method push

    $oh->push( one => 1, two => 2);

Add a list of key-value pairs to the end of the ordered hash.  If a key already
exists in the hash, it will be deleted and re-inserted at the end with the new
value.

Returns the number of keys after the push is complete.

=cut

sub push {
    my ( $self, @pairs ) = @_;
    while (@pairs) {
        my ( $k, $v ) = splice( @pairs, 0, 2 );
        if ( exists $self->[_DATA]{$k} ) {
            # splice out key
            # XXX could put an index on this later if linear search is too slow
            my $r = $self->[_KEYS];
            my $i = List::Util::first { $r->[$_] eq $k } 0 .. $#$r;
            splice @$r, $i, 1;
        }
        push @{ $self->[_KEYS] }, $k;
        $self->[_DATA]{$k} = $v;
    }
    return scalar @{ $self->[_KEYS] };
}

=method pop

    ($key, $value) = $oh->pop;

Removes and returns the last key-value pair in the ordered hash.

=cut

sub pop {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $key = pop @{ $self->[_KEYS] };
    return $key, delete $self->[_DATA]{$key};
}

=method unshift

    $oh->unshift( one => 1, two => 2 );

Adds a list of key-value pairs to the beginning of the ordered hash.  If a key
already exists, it will be deleted and re-inserted at the beginning with the
new value.

Returns the number of keys after the unshift is complete.

=cut

sub unshift {
    my ( $self, @pairs ) = @_;
    while (@pairs) {
        my ( $k, $v ) = splice( @pairs, -2, 2 );
        if ( exists $self->[_DATA]{$k} ) {
            # splice out key
            # XXX could put an index on this later if linear search is too slow
            my $r = $self->[_KEYS];
            my $i = List::Util::first { $r->[$_] eq $k } 0 .. $#$r;
            splice @$r, $i, 1;
        }
        unshift @{ $self->[_KEYS] }, $k;
        $self->[_DATA]{$k} = $v;
    }
    return scalar @{ $self->[_KEYS] };
}

=method shift

    ($key, $value) = $oh->shift;

Removes and returns the first key-value pair in the ordered hash.

=cut

sub shift {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $key = shift @{ $self->[_KEYS] };
    return $key, delete $self->[_DATA]{$key};
}

=method merge

    $oh->merge( one => 1, two => 2 );

Merges a list of key-value pairs into the ordered hash.  If a key already
exists, its value is replaced.  Otherwise, the key-value pair is added at
the end of the hash.

=cut

sub merge {
    my ( $self, @pairs ) = @_;
    while (@pairs) {
        my ( $k, $v ) = splice( @pairs, -2, 2 );
        if ( !exists $self->[_DATA]{$k} ) {
            CORE::push @{ $self->[_KEYS] }, $k;
        }
        $self->[_DATA]{$k} = $v;
    }
    return scalar @{ $self->[_KEYS] };
}

=method as_list

    @pairs = $oh->as_list;
    @pairs = $oh->as_list( @keys );

Returns an ordered list of key-value pairs. If no arguments are given, all
pairs in the hash are returned.  If a list of keys is given, the returned list
includes only those key-value pairs in the given order.  Keys that aren't in
the original will have the value C<undef>.

=cut

sub as_list {
    my ( $self, @keys ) = @_;
    @keys = @{ $self->[_KEYS] } unless @keys;
    return map { ; $_ => $self->[_DATA]{$_} } @keys;
}

=method iterator

    $iter = $oh->iterator;
    $iter = $oh->iterator( reverse $oh->keys ); # reverse

    while ( my ($key,$value) = $iter->() ) { ... }

Returns a code reference that returns a single key-value pair (in order) on
each invocation, or the empty list if all keys are visited.

If no arguments are given, the iterator walks the entire hash in order.  If a
list of keys is provided, the iterator walks the hash in that order. Unknown
keys will return C<undef>.

The list of keys to return is set when the iterator is generator.  Keys added
later will not be returned.  Delete keys will return C<undef>.

=cut

sub iterator {
    my ( $self, @keys ) = @_;
    @keys = @{ $self->[_KEYS] } unless @keys;
    my $data = $self->[_DATA];
    return sub {
        return unless @keys;
        my $key = CORE::shift(@keys);
        return ( $key => $data->{$key} );
    };
}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements an ordered hash, meaning that it associates keys with
values like a Perl hash, but keeps the keys in a consistent order.  Because it
is implemented as an object and manipulated with method calls, it is much
slower than a Perl hash.  This is the cost of keeping order.

=head1 OVERLOADING

=head2 Boolean

    if ( $oh ) { ... }

When used in boolean context, a Hash::Ordered object is true if it has any entries
and false otherwise.

=head1 MOTIVATION

For a long time, I used L<Tie::IxHash> for ordered hashes, but I grew
frustrated with things it lacked, like a cheap way to copy an IxHash object or
a convenient iterator when not using the tied interface.  As I looked at its
implementation, it seemed more complex than I though it needed, with an extra
level of indirection that slows data access.

Given that frustration, I started experimenting with the simplest thing I
thought could work for an ordered hash: a hash of key-value pairs and an array
with key order.

As I worked on this, I also started searching for other modules doing similar
things.  What I found fell broadly into two camps: modules based on tie (even
if they offered an OO interface), and pure OO modules.  They all either lacked
features I deemed necessary or else seemed overly-complex in either
implementation or API.

Hash::Ordered attempts to find the sweet spot with simple implementation,
reasonably good efficiency for most common operations, and a rich, intuitive
API.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This section describes other ordered-hash modules I found on CPAN.  For
benchmarking results, see L<Hash::Ordered::Benchmarks>.

=head2 Tie modules

The following modules offer some sort of tie interface.  I don't like ties, in
general, because of the extra indirection involved over a direct method call, but
if you are willing to pay that penalty, you might want to try one of these.

L<Tie::IxHash> is probably the most well known and includes an OO API.  If its
warts and performance profile aren't a problem, it might serve.

L<Tie::LLHash> I haven't used, but the linked-list implementation might be
worthwhile if you expect to do a lot of deletions.

L<Tie::Hash::Indexed> is implemented in XS and thus seems promising if pure-Perl
isn't a criterion; it often fails tests on Perl 5.18 and above due to the hash
randomization change.

These other modules have very specific designs/limitations and I didn't find
any of them suitable for general purpose use:

=for :list
* L<Tie::Array::AsHash> — array elements split with separator; tie API only
* L<Tie::Hash::Array> — ordered alphabetically; tie API only
* L<Tie::InsertOrderHash> — ordered by insertion; tie API only
* L<Tie::StoredOrderHash> — ordered by last update; tie API only

=head2 Other ordered hash modules

Other modules stick with an object-oriented API, with a wide variety of
implementation approaches.

L<Array::AsHash> is essentially an inverse implementation from Hash::Ordered.
It keeps pairs in an array and uses a hash to index into the array.  I think
this indirection makes hash-like operations slower, but getting the list of
pairs back out is much faster.  It takes an arrayref to initialize, but can
shallow copy it if needed.  I think this is a reasonable alternative if static
construction and listing out contents is more common than individual item
access.

These other modules have restrictions or particularly complicated
implementations (often relying on C<tie>) and thus I didn't think any of them
really suitable for use:

=for :list
* L<Array::Assign> — arrays with named access; restricted keys
* L<Array::OrdHash> — overloads array/hash deref and uses internal tied data
* L<Data::Pairs> — array of key-value hashrefs; allows duplicate keys
* L<Data::OMap> — array of key-value hashrefs; no duplicate keys
* L<Data::XHash> — blessed, tied hashref with doubly-linked-list
